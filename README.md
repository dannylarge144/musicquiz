# musicquiz
A simple quiz game that tests the user's knowledge of a handful of songs. The user has 2 chances to guess each of the 5 randomly chosen songs from only the initials of the title and the name of the artist. You can play more than 5 rounds by entering your password as 'hardcore'.

This game was my NEA for GCSE Computer Science.
